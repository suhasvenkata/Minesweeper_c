# Minesweeper_c

During our third semester, we crafted a Minesweeper game as part of our Data Structures and Applications (DSA) mini project. This version closely resembles the classic Minesweeper typically found on Windows platforms. Our implementation heavily relies on linked lists for efficient navigation across rows and columns within the game grid. Random placement of mines within the grid is facilitated using the rand() function. To guarantee the game's smooth operation, we incorporated several additional features tailored to meet the game's specific requirements. Should any revisions be deemed necessary, please feel free to suggest adjustments or modifications.
